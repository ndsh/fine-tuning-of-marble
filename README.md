### PCB
Revisions
- [ ] Redesign the PCB stack into a single square board
- [ ] DRV8825 M0, M1, M2 to Pins
- [ ] Integrate TDA2030 circuit
- [ ] Switch terminal blocks with WAGO 2060 SMD
- [ ] Integrate PROTOSEQ circuit
- [ ] Expose all available pins
- [ ] Re-examine the audio interface between PROTOSEQ and TDA2030 (Is it really necessary to have the TDA2030?)
